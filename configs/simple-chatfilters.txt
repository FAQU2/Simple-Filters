// This plugin supports max. 100 filters with a max. length of 50 characters each. Empty lines or commented out lines don't count as filters.
// It is recommended that you use quote marks to delimit your filters. Text that comes after the quote marks won't be added as part of the filter.
// All filters are case insensitive, therefore "thisbadword" will also detect "ThisBADwOrD".
